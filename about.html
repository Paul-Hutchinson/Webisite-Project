            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <br>
            <P> Paul has a proven track record spanning the last decade, working within some of the worlds leading design houses. Including the studio of prominent Memphis Group designer Gerard Taylor, of whom is the creative director of Orangebox (part of the Steelcase group), one of the worlds most progressive office furniture companies. Paul has built up a diverse skill set, working within all aspects of the design industry, including the studios of Martino Gamper, Phillipe Malouin, Tom Price and more recently the multi award winning design and innovation consultancy PearsonLloyd. Over his career Paul has worked on projects for a range of high profile companies, such as Prada, Anya Hindmarch, Nike, Muuto, Valextra, Thonet, Umbra, and The Serpentine Gallery. Paul has trained under some of the most prolific designers of today, who have come from the lineage of 'design' being all encompassing across the industry, in what has today become segregated into 'specialisms'. With this in mind, he has made efforts to expand his knowledge into what is apparent as the 'next frontier' in the evolution of design. He has gained exposure to Python, HTML and CSS through introductory studies with Code Nation, and aims to develop further into these areas.   </P>
