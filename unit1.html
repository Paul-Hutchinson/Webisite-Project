                        <br>
                        <P>IT is at the heart of every part of modern day life. It is integral to any business operating today, even traditional trades and practices, that on the surface haven’t changed for centuries, are using IT for day to day operations. It is used for accounting, payments - B2B & B2C, stock management, manufacturing, design, communication, security, marketing, advertising, customer interactions and much more.</P>
                        <br>
                        <h3>1.2</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>The methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully, will depend on the size and complexity of each project. An understanding of the computer language required (python/html/css) is a must, after this assets like Google and YouTube become a necessity as they will allow for research and up-skilling to produce work that would have been outside the potential of current skill levels.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>1.3</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>For this project (making a personal website) I shall be using a couple of different tools, to allow me to have a clear view of the outcome I am aiming for, all steps needed to achieve this, what has been done so far, and time constraints. I shall be using Trello ( https://trello.com/b/gELrsTpy/personal-website ) for the to-do list, and possibly an iPad with procreate to produce a storyboard of the website.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>1.4</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>There are several risk factors when carrying out any digital project that should always be taken in to account to help mitigate the risk of failure. The main risk from an outside source is cyber security and risks of data breach/loss, as well as hijacking. This has the potential to not only jeopardise the project, but also the entire company. Other risks that could lead to project failure is mainly hardware related issue, which may not always be within your reach of fixing. Typically an accident or malfunction could cause hard drive corruption, or even just specific files could become corrupted. If processes such as backups locally, and off site (via cloud or physically) have not been carried out, these files may be lost forever. If internet goes down in your area, this may also lead to delivery dates being pushed/missed.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>1.5</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>The IT systems needed to complete digital projects successfully, will depend on the size and complexity of each project. For instance some projects may require access to large data storage, servers, large RAM and processing and graphic power, software, as well as render farms. But all digital projects require a basic level of hardware and access; a computer(laptop) with moderate power, and an internet access. After this there are different variables that influence the IT systems and software selected; If the job requires a lot of travel and constant communication, a high powered laptop and a phone may be needed. If the project/client has a high security protocol, it may be necessary to work within a secure location, hardwired in behind a firewall.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>1.6</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>The technologies I chose to aid me in this project will help in a number of different ways. Trello will allow me to have a clear understanding of what is needed to be done, and not to waist time having to re-think the process every time. Visual Studio Code will be used for the coding, as this is the platform I have been trained in, and have some understanding of. I shall be using Google Chrome to view the visual outcomes of the coding. I have also chosen to draw a storyboard on my iPad using Procreate as I believe It will allow me to map out the entire process, giving me to have a clear mind whilst laying out the HTML structure and styling in CSS. Github is used to publish a digital portfolio, so that others can view my code, including my team, over developers, and potential employers.</p>

                        <h3>1.7</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has an impact on any digital platform and interacts/stores its users data, as well as email/contact lists. GDPR was put introduce by the EU on May 25th, 2018, and enforces these regulations using large fines if violated. GDPR was introduced by the EU to “harmonise” data privacy laws across all members of the European Union. It also allows individuals  the right to request how their personal data is being collected and stored from individual companies. The large fines imposed if GDPR is breached is extremely important to keep in mind when starting any digital project that may require users data.</p>

                        <h3>2.1</h3>
                        <br>
                        <P>At the start of this project, I selected Trello, Visual Studio Code, Google Chrome, and Procreate as the IT tools I would be using. During the process of building the website, I find that Trello has little impact, although I do believe that is down to a lack of habitual use on my behalf. I am still using Google Chrome to view the visual results of the HTML and CSS and is a vital part of the process, as I am having to use a lot of trial and error whilst learning and implementing these languages.</P>
                        <br>
                        <h3>2.2</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p> For the organisation of this project I used Trello and found it was a great tool that made it easy for me to keep track of what was needed to be done, although it does require an internet connection, making working offline, or on the move problematic.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            For writing the code I used Visual Studio Code. It was a necessity for this project, as aboth HTML and CSS had to be written in this software, It would be beneficial if there was a visual generator in this software, as the constant back and forth with Google Chrome to check changes became laborious and inefficient. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I used Google Chrome to check all alterations made to my code, and found it very useful in the trial and error process of making the website. Any web browser would work, I chose Google Chrome as it is what I already have installed and it has a nice user interface.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I used Pages to write all the coursework, and to spell check all writing before placing into the website. I chose Pages as it is pre-installed on Apple computers, and allows for the file to be exported into most formats if necessary.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I used an Apple MacBook Pro for this project, as it is my personal preference as the interface is beyond any other computer/software on the market. It is also widely used throughout the design industry, so helps if any crossover work with others is needed. An additional plus for Apple hardware is that operating software as well as the basics of Pages, Numbers and Keynotes are included and updated regularly free of charge, and that using other Apple devices means I benefit from the ecosystem. There are fewer viruses / there is better protection against getting viruses which helps mitigate risk.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>2.3</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>I am happy with the simplicity of the website, as it is clean and direct and does not give the user a visual overload, allowing for the information to be digested easier. I can understand that for some it may be seen as too minimal.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>2.4</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>I would like to improve the website, by adding a slide presentation of a selection of my work to the homepage, as well as adding portfolio pages, but currently this is beyond my knowledge and skill set.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>2.5</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>All outcomes match requirements and are fit for purpose, I have done this by going tour every link on the website takes you to the correct location, for broken links I went through the html and fixed/adjusted the link until fixed.</p>

                        <h3>3.1</h3>
                        <br>
                        <P> During this process, I did not find the organisation tolls (Trello) to be of any benefit. This is most likely due to my attention being fully occupied with getting the website code to work.
                        I don’t believe I cold have been any more efficient in this process as it was an initial learning exercise, built from trial and error. I think building this website as part of a team would  not have helped with efficiency as most of the classes are used across the various pages.</P>
                        <br>
                        <h3>3.2</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>To improve efficiency you may work from an auto synced cloud drive, such as dropbox. This will allow multiple users to easily interact with up to date files and projects irrelevant of the users location, instead of having to send new files back and forth every time a change has been made. You might create shortcuts to the folders that you use the most, this saves a tremendous amount of time, If your current project folder is deep within a filing structure. It can also help to sync devices so that contact details and frequently visited websites/resources are available across all of your platforms.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>3.3</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>If redoing this website, I would create a clear timetable for the week for myself. This would allow a clear slots of uninterrupted work, so that it can have my full attention. This could be done with trello or similar software.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>3.4</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>To test digital solutions (in this case a website), I would firstly check through the html to see if there are any apparent mistakes. I would then do the same for CSS. After this I would view the file in Google Chrome, I would go through all links and pages to test for any bugs.
                        Once everything is working, I would then ask my peers to review the code and visual run through of the website to see if they find any issues.</p>
