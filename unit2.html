                        <br>
                        <P>I have aimed to keep the visuals of this website extremely simple. For the index page, I have a visually simple banner style nav bar across the top of the page, with an image of a piece of my work.<br>
                        <br>
                        Clicking onto the projects page, takes you through to a page with the options ‘Unit 1’ and ‘Unit 2’ these are links that take you through to the pages with ‘Unit 1’s’ and ‘Unit 2’s’ content. This content in centred to the page and width is adaptive to the size of the screen.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The ‘About’ page has an image of myself, aligned left that is adaptive taking up 33.3333% of the screen, with content placed to the right of it.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The ‘Contact’ page is very simple with a centred  LinkedIn link, and a location for an email address.</P>
                        <br>
                        <h3>1.5</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Copyright constraints can affect a website, and they need to be taken into consideration. When displaying images, they must be your own or with consent from the image owner. Otherwise there may be serious legal implications. </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>1.6</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>There are a variety of access issues that can affect a website user who has a disability. A lack of clear or consistent content organisation as well as a lack of graphics can be challenging for users with learning disabilities and memory impairments. To help these users, website can stick to a clear template, or offer and alternate site. Users with seizure disorders may have serious reactions to animations, blinking text or audio. This can be avoided by warning the suer before opening the site, and/or giving the option to turn off those features.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>1.7</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>There are a few different file types that can be used for websites.
                        There are the file formats HTML, CSS, and Javascript. And there is a range of file types, JPEG, PNG, GIFs, and MP4s.
                        Jpeg is the most popular, and is considered to be the  be one of the best due to the file compression, whilst maintaining complex colours and shading.</p>
